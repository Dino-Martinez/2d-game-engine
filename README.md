# TypeGame - A Simple 2D TypeScript Game Engine:

## My Purpose

The purpose of this project is to provide tools for building simple 2D physics-enabled games using typescript. These tools are meant to be intuitive and simple to understand; however, they must also be robust and powerful.

## My Goals

  - Provide robust tools for all omni-relevant physics interactions, including:

    1. Collisions between physics objects
    2. Collisions with the canvas boundaries
    3. Vector-based movement
    4. User control over specific objects
    5. Particle emmission

  - Provide a meaningful and easy to follow tutorial on how to use the above
  - Create a series of games using these tools to showcase their versatility.

## Road Map
  1. Build alpha versions of the basic underlying tools (Vector, Entity, PhysicsObject)
  2. Build alpha versions of common game objects, using those tools (Ball, Rectangle, Triangle, Polygon)
  3. Release alpha build v0.0.0-alpha
  4. Add controllability flags to all objects, allowing people to define which objects can be controlled by the user and which cannot
  5. Add control functionality (keyboard/mouse based inputs to denote optional control flags - things like move, jump, etc)
